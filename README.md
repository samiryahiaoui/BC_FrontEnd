# BC_FrontEnd
Syndication contract simple front end interface for testing

The front end allows borrowers and lenders to join the lending platform. The borrowers can apply for a loan with a given amount, and the lenders provide bids on portions of the loan with desired yields. It is somewhat similar to the syndication loan process for corporate borrowers and banks.

In this version, no funds are exchaged. It is merely a simulation to test the lending platform.
